**Couchbase Lite Wrapper** is a library written in Swift that makes it easy for you to implement database CRUD operations with [Couchbase Lite for iOS and MacOS](https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-ios)

## Requirements
- iOS 13.0+ | MacOS 10.13+

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

The Swift Package Manager is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

The Package Manager is included in Swift 3.0 and above.

```swift
dependencies: [
        .package(name: "CouchbaseLiteWrapper",
                 url: "https://github.com/koombea/couchbase-lite-wrapper-ios.git", 
                 from: "1.0.0"),
    ],
```

## The Basics

### Setup

Create a couchbase database for each of the models you want to store

```swift
couchbaseDatabase = CouchbaseDatabase(databaseName: "User")

```

### Create / Update document

```swift
let document = CouchbaseDocument(id: "1", attributes: ["name": "Brad", "last_name": "Depp"])
couchbaseDatabase.save(document)

```

### Fetch documents

```swift
let expression = Expression.property("attributes.name").equalTo(Expression.string("Brad"))
let documents = couchbaseDatabase.fetchAll(whereExpression: expression)

```

### Delete Documents

```swift
let expression = Expression.property("attributes.name").equalTo(Expression.string("Brad"))
couchbaseDatabase.deleteAll(whereExpression: expression)

```

## Couchbase Lite Wrapper + Codable
[Codable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/codable) is a type alias for the `Encodable` and `Decodable` protocols part of the Swift Standard Library framework that makes your data types encodable and decodable for compatibility with external representations such as JSON.

Having a `User: Codable` model, you can fetch models like this:

```swift
let users = couchbaseDatabase.fetchAll(User.self)

```
